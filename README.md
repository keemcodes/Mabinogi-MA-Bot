# Mabinogi-MA-Bot
Yes it's what you think. I wrote a bot to fully automate running Martials Arts Competition between 6 characters on a multi client setup

So this is how it works... I boot up 6 clients. I had 2 level 10k+ characters.

# How does it work?
My character was the leader character and damage dealer. With blaze gear I could 1 shot most MA rounds non crit and any round cept Fleta with a crit.
My friend quit, so I would use his character with puppet and melee gear to act 6 the room into my blaze.
It uses image detection for everything
# What could it do?
* Buy MA passes
* Enter room and walk to middle where mobs spawn
* 2nd character act 6s the room
* 1st character blazes the room
* If finish screen doesnt appear, both characters activate FH and fh the rest of room
* if finish screen appears, all characters exit room

I used this bot to harvest 500m+ between 6 characters. You probably seen me on channel 7 with all my bots spamming MA.
A full MA run is like 54k if I remember.
6 characters, 320k each run
1.3m an hour
20-30m a day... :)
